			<h2>INTERACTION DESIGN</h2>
			<h3>Title: Drones on Patrol</h3>
				<p>Team - Angie Kuo/ Jacqueline Tenges/ Gaby Hartono/ Jihyun Park</p></div>
			<br>
			<strong>Our mission is to design how an autonomous vehicle could help to solve the problems of parker rangers dealing with in their jobs.</strong><br><br>
			<center><h2>Background research</h2></center>
			<p>In the beginning, we conducted online background research to understand what duties are carried out by the ranger team and what the existing tools they are using at the moment. Also, the data can help us to prepare the interview questions to allow partipants feel more reliable because of our well prepare and more willing to help us.</p>

			<br>
			<h2><center>Interviews / Observations</center></h2>
			<p>Our next step was to invite volunteer participants for interviews in order to understand the work process and experience of rangers in enforcing parking regulations. Our participants included managers and staffs of parking regulation department in Burwood Council and Strathfield Council. We also observe the behaviors of the parking rangers that was patrolling in Townhall and performed a quick interview with them. Look for participants was not easy because people are not obligate to help us and we didn't know what their working hours is, an email to contact previously can help save more time than find volunteer on street. Also, 80% of peple they are willing to help.</p><br>
			<p>After performing the interviews, we got a deeper insight of the duty of a parking officer such as their typical day process of a parking officer, the difficulties and issues from parking officer perspective and managing perspective, what is the existing tools they are using and what kind of new technologies will be considered. we found out some issues of parking regulations:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Human nature of violence </strong>- verbal and physical abuse that always happens when people confront the regulation.</li>
				<li><strong>Efficiency</strong> - somedays parking rangers are not really efficient, one day they may not work as quickly when they are feeling lazy</li>
				<li><strong>Handling leave of staff</strong> - the manager has difficulty to operation people sick or annual leave</li>
				<li><strong>Control aspect</strong> - a new technology must previously be endorsed by governing bodies</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Concept ideation</h2>
			<p>After we learn of the issues which happen in the manager and ranger's duty. We discussed and sketched our ideas on a paper.</p>
			<center><img src="img/wb11.jpg" class="image" border="1"></center>
			<h2>Hand Drawn Sketches</h2>
			<center><img src="img/sketches.gif" class="image" border="1"></center>
			<h2>Storyboards</h2>
			<p>We finally generate three main concepts of innovating the parking officer working process by using an autonomous vehicle and made their relative storyboards.</p>
			<center><strong>Concept 1</strong>
			</center>
			<div class="storyboard">Mobile Drone Patrol Parking Officer App - A mobile app for parking officers to use in combination with a drone technology to easily and efficiently detect cars that breach parking laws.</div>
			<center><img src="img/wb12.jpg" class="image" border="1"></center>
			<center><img src="img/wb12.jpg" class="image" border="1"></center>
			<center><strong>Concept 2</strong>
			</center>
			<div class="storyboard">A parking drone platform for management use -  The second concept is a desktop app designed for senior manager compliance or parking managers to dispatch drones, detect drones, and relocate drones to a certain area whilst being in the office.</div>
			<center><img src="img/storyboard2.jpg" class="image" border="1"></center>
			<center><strong>Concept 3</strong>
			</center>
			<div class="storyboard">Parking Management App for Drivers - The third concept is a mobile app for drivers to find parking and be alerted of their parking status from the drones’ surveys. Unlike the previous two concepts, it focuses on improving accuracy and management of parking rules on the driver’s side.</div>
			<center><img src="img/storyboard3.jpg" class="image" border="1"></center>
			<h2>Wireframe</h2>
			<p>We draw the low fidelity prototyping in order to generate the initial interface from the ideas.</p>
			<center><strong>Concept 1</strong>
			</center>
			<center><img src="img/we92.png" class="image" border="1"></center>
			<center><img src="img/iteration2.JPG" class="image" border="1"></center>
			<center><strong>Concept 2</strong>
			</center>
			<center><img src="img/lofi2.png" class="image" border="1"></center>
			<center><strong>Concept 3</strong>
			</center>
			<center><img src="img/wireframe.JPG" class="image" border="1"></center>
			<h2>Mockups</h2>
			<p>We iterate our concept by using the feedback from pilot testing. We mockup the wireframe by using the software Sketch and made it interactive by Invision to prepare for the coming evaluation events.</p>
			<center><strong>Concept 1: <a href=https://invis.io/K5OEF3UBVPD#/323643742_Login target="_blank">Invision link</a></strong></center>
			<center><img src="img/w933.jpg" class="image" border="1"></center>
			<center><strong>Concept 1: Iterate </strong></center>
			<center><img src="img/iteration3.JPG" class="image" border="1"></center>
			<center><strong>Concept 2:</strong></center>
			<center><img src="img/mockup2.jpg" class="image" border="1"></center>
			<center><strong>Concept 3:</strong></center>
			<center><img src="img/wireframe3.jpg" class="image" border="1"></center>
			<h2>First evaluation</h2>
			<p>We meet with the staffs at Strathfield Council to do the evolution for both our concepts. They performed the user testing by using the think-aloud method, which was we gave them a task to perform (print an infringement notice). They described the steps and expressed their thoughts and feelings, at the meanwhile, we observed and recorded his behavior and pain points. Then we perform interviews with them.</p><br>
			<p>They were more interested in the patrol parking officer app because the interface was familiar to current tools and the processes easily understood by the parking officers, but they also stated that the management app is quite useful that a manager can manage the whole area by using a desktop.</p>
			<center><img src="img/evaluation.JPG" class="image"></center>
			<h2>Development of concept</h2>
			<p>Based on the feedback from the evaluation. We chose to iterate on concept one - the mobile drone patrol app for parking officers for our final concept. Our final mobile drone patrol app incorporates previous feedback and aspects of concept two to provide a more flexible and efficient use of drones to aid in parking enforcement.</p>
			<center><img src="img/hifi1.jpg" class="image" border="1"></center>
			<p>The main functions of App</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Login page to enter username and password for security purpose</li>
				<li>Index page icons (Map, Parking rules, Print notice, Setting, Support)</li>
				<li>The separate areas on the map allow user to choose the patrol area directly and more easily</li>
				<li>A drop down menu which shows the username and select function</li>
				<li>The map shows where the location of drones is, when a user clicks on the drone, it will show up the details and screen recording from the drone</li>
				<li>An alert will pop up when a parking violate detected</li>
				<li>Step by step to guide the user to issue an infringement notice more easily</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Second evaluation</h2>
			<p>We conducted a second evaluation to test our development concept with the staff in Burwood Council. This time we only test the developed concept one.</p>
			<br><Strong>Findings:</Strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Many users expressed how easy it was to use the app</li>
				<li>Majority of officers stated that although the app looks good overall, they won’t be able to understand the full scope of our app unless they use it in real life</li>
				<li>Some are still quite skeptical about the idea, whilst others were advocating for the change to happen</li>
				<li>Users don't know the battery life of the drones</li>
				<li>A manager suggested having a managing platform</li>
				<li>The details of the infringement notice were not enough</li>
			</ul>
			<center><img src="img/eluation2.JPG" border="0" class="image"></center>
			<h2>Critical Evaluation</h2>
			<p>After we added a managing mode which can check the battery level of all the drones and all the breach records. We then performed a final evaluation with the senior ranger in Strathfield Council. This evaluation also conducted at outdoor in order to test is the app suitable to use in a sunlight environment, and we found the following areas for improvement:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The icons are too small and did not fit his finger properly, and</li>
				<li>The fonts are too small, he needs to zoom in when he read</li>
				<li>Manager view and officer view are confusing</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>High fidelity prototyping</h2>
			<p>We worked collaboratively on the high fidelity prototyping that taking into consideration the previous finding and recommendations, we then finally decided to made the following changes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Distinguished the worker view and manager view on the app by using red and blue colour.</li>
				<li>Made the fonts bigger</li>
				<li>Made the button more contrasting by changing the fonts to upper cases and changed a darker green background</li>
			</ul>
