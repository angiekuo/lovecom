			  Hi, I'm Angie. I am passionate about web design and coding. Over these past few years, I have realized that apart from the importance of visual design such as a combination of fonts, shapes colour and layouts, user experience is also vital. I therefore consider that designing a good user friendly website which allows users to feel happy will increase the likelihood of them visiting the site again. Since recognising the importance of ensuring a good user experience, I committed myself to ensuring I meet this goal and delivering excellent results for my previous designs and helping my clients grow their business effectively. <br>
			    <br>
			    Technology is changing rapidly with each passing day. Few years ago I worked as a freelancer and designed various different websites. However to further develop my skill set and be cutting edge in this area of work, I completed some design courses at CQU and USYD to up to date in new design trends. I always feel happy to learn new skills and I am always seeking new and exciting opportunities to make sure my skills are relevant in modern society.<br><br>
