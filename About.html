			  Hi, I'm Angie. I am passionate about web design and coding. In this decade, I discovered that apart from the importance of visual design such as a combination of fonts, shapes colour and layouts, user experience is also vital. I therefore consider designing a good user experience website which allows users to feel happy to visit again. I committed to delivering excellent results for my previous designs and help my clients grow their business effectively. <br>
			    <br>
			    Technology is changing rapidly with each passing day. After I designed a few websites when I worked as a freelancer, I study the design courses at CQU and USYD to up to date in new design trends. I always feel happy to learn new skills and I am always training it.
